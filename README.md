# Machine-Learning
Weather forecast- This project will use linear regression to predict the temperature from its other features. The project will also show how to do dummy varibles, avoding multicolinarity, finding the correct features and so forth.

---------------------------------------------------------

Gradient Descent- This project will show how to implement gradient descent. I have used Linear Regression as an example to show how you can implement gradeint descent in linear regression istead of OLS.
I have used 2 examples to show this.

We note from this project that OLS is computationally expensive whilst graident descent is only used when there are lots of features for effiency.

The project will show when you run the gradeint descent and OLS, that gradeint descent takes longer and should be avoided for Linear Regression algorithm unless we use C++ where we can improve the performance somewhat


------------------------------------------------------------

knnclassification- This project will show you how to use KNN to classify Pulsar starts. It will also show how to use KNN with techniques such as grid search, Cross-validations and so forth.

------------------------------------------------------------

KNN-Regression- This project will use KNN to predict prices by connect knn with regression


---------------------------------------------------------------

Logistic-Regression- This project will classify cancer tumours based on its features using the logistic function.
